              First I want to state, that "playing" an instrument - whatever level - is meant here. <br>
              So even "experimenting" with other instruments can be understood as "playing". <br><br>
              Please everyone raises his / her hand. <br>
              If you can't answer one of my following 3 questions with "Yes", 
              please take down your hand.

              Music produces brain-building compounds and neural growth factors that are making you smarter, stronger and better at doing
              activities throughout the day.
