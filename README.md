# Presentations

To work with toolkits for monorepos, I am adding presentations build with different tools (atm only reveal.js, but others to come), to see, how toolkits like [lerna](https://github.com/lerna/lerna) or [bit](https://github.com/teambit/bit) help and work with those.

## list of presentations

- How learning a second musical instrument is activating your brain
- How does async / await work?
